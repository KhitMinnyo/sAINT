sAINT installer script for Kali Linux. But, it may be fine on Ubuntu &amp; other Debian Linux. If you use this script, you can easily start sAINT with a single command "sAINT" and then you can get output file just enter "sTarget"  in your terminal.
(s)AINT is a Spyware Generator for Windows systems written in Java.
I used the original file of sAINT from https://github.com/tiagorlampert/sAINT .
I just make easier shortcut command only.
It is tested on Kali Linux (100% OK).
It may be used on Ubuntu and other Debian Linux distros. 
You can easily install sAINT with this script. 
How to use this script ...

This script needs root permission. So type sudo su in your terminal first.
# sudo su
Sudo password need. Password is your login password. 
You cannot see anything while you type password in your terminal.
Just type correctly & hit enter.
And then you can install sAINT with the following commands.
